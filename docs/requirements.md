# talk2Py - Software Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the requirements for talk2Py, an SDK designed to enable developers to build conversational and agentic capabilities into Python applications.

### 1.2 Product Scope
talk2Py transforms traditional Python applications into interactive agents with natural language understanding, contextual awareness, and action execution capabilities.

### 1.3 Intended Audience
This document is intended for developers, project managers, and stakeholders involved in the development and use of talk2Py.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
talk2Py is a standalone SDK that integrates with existing Python applications to add conversational AI capabilities without requiring extensive machine learning knowledge.

### 2.2 Product Features
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Process and understand user input in natural language
- **Conversation Management**: Maintain context throughout multi-turn conversations
- **Action Execution**: Execute Python functions based on user intents
- **State Tracking**: Keep track of workflow state and user preferences
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily extend with custom components and integrations

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
Primary users are Python developers seeking to add conversational capabilities to their applications without deep expertise in NLP or AI.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- Python 3.12+
- Compatible with all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Optional dependency: uv (for dependency management)

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Natural Language Processing
FR-1.1: The system shall parse and interpret natural language inputs.
FR-1.2: The system shall extract intents and entities from user queries.
FR-1.3: The system shall handle ambiguous or incomplete queries appropriately.

### 3.2 Conversation Management
FR-2.1: The system shall maintain conversation context across multiple interactions.
FR-2.2: The system shall support follow-up questions without restating context.

### 3.3 Action Execution
FR-3.1: The system shall map user intents to Python functions.
FR-3.2: The system shall support a decorator-based API for registering commands.
FR-3.3: The system shall execute the appropriate function with extracted parameters.

### 3.4 State Management
FR-4.1: The system shall track workflow state.
FR-4.2: The system shall persist user preferences between sessions.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
NFR-1.1: The system shall start streaming responses within 500ms (excluding external API calls).

### 4.2 Usability
NFR-2.1: The API shall follow Python conventions for ease of use.
NFR-2.2: Integration shall require minimal code changes to existing applications.

### 4.3 Reliability
NFR-3.1: The system shall gracefully handle errors in registered functions.
NFR-3.2: The system shall provide meaningful error messages.

### 4.4 Supportability
NFR-4.1: The system shall provide comprehensive documentation.
NFR-4.2: The system shall include examples for common use cases.

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### 5.1 Quick Start
The following example demonstrates basic usage:

```python
from talk2py import command

# Register functions that can be called by the agent
@command
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get the current weather for a location."""
    # Your weather API code here
    return f"It's sunny in {location}!"
```

Run the command `talk2py.run main.py` and start talking to the agent.
