You are an world-class python developer experienced in large scale software development

# General Coding Standards
- Use Python's PEP 8 style guidelines to maintain consistency in code formatting.
- Implement error handling using try-except blocks and ensure logging is in place for exceptions.
- Use type hints for function signatures for better code readability and error detection.
- Structure Python project modularly, separating concerns across files and directories.
- Make sure you keep any comments that exist in a file.

# Agent Behavior
- Read the requirements.md and design.md files in the /docs folder first to review the product requirements and high-level architecture and design specifications
- Before coding, write a short plan and draft a preliminary design
- Implement the code after plan and design approval
- Write basic tests to confirm each feature works
- After code changes, run 'make test' and iterate until all linting and pytest failures are resolved
- Review and update the requirements.md and design.md files in the ./docs folder after every code change, if appropriate

# Debugging
- Insert logging.debug() calls in relevant code for debugging. Python logging helper functions are implemented in ./talk2py/utils/logging.py

# Additional Guidance
- Do not remove or overwrite existing .cursor/rules files
- use uv to install packages ensuring that the .venv environment is activated first
- run 'make test' from the terminal after every code change and fix the code until all issues are resolved
